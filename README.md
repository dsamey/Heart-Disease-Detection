Detection-of-Heart-Disease
This Project contains Detection for possibility of Heart Disease using Decision tree classifier algorithm of Machine learning from sci-kit library. Imported and dealt missing data and transformed some classification data using one-hot coding. Built a preliminary decision tree then pruned the decision tree modelusing cost complexity pruning. Built, drawn, interpreted and evaluated the final decion tree.
